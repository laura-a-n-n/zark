# zark

[Zark](https://zarbalatrax.com/zark/) is a text-based adventure game that is entirely auto-generated by a [draw.io diagram](https://draw.io). Using this codebase, you, too, could create your own text-based game. Just create a draw.io diagram and you're basically done.

## how to use

1. Install (see next section).
2. In a draw.io file, go to File > Export as... > XML.
3. Replace [public/assets/ZARK.drawio.xml](https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/zark/blob/dev/public/assets/ZARK.drawio.xml) with your XML file. Alternatively, you can just put it in that folder, and change the `FILE_PATH` in [src/zark.ts](https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/zark/blob/dev/src/zark.ts).
4. Run `bun start`. You can now view your game by going to `localhost:8080` in your browser!

You can edit the HTML, CSS, and other assets in the `assets` folder as needed, and your changes will live-update.

We leave the details of how exactly to make the right draw.io diagram as an exercise for the reader. (Maybe just look at the existing example.)

## how to install

Download this repo and open the folder in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/zark.git
cd zark
```

Then install [Bun](https://bun.sh). (You can just use NPM too if you already have that.)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Alternatively, `npm install` works for NPM.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.22. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
